# Solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem

The solution takes an input of N and generates N random points in a Two-dimensional space (x, y are in [-10_000, 10_000]).

The solution is a Genetic algorithm that uses One-Point Crossover and Mutation by swapping two elements. (Can be extended to use others).
